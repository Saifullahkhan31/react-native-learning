# React Native Learning Repository

Welcome to my React Native Learning Repository!  
This repo is dedicated to my journey of learning React Native, following along with various YouTube video courses and tutorials. The goal is to document, experiment, and practice key React Native concepts as I explore the ecosystem.

## About

- This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with React Native features and concepts.
- Code examples, exercises, and notes are based on content from YouTube courses and community tutorials.
- It’s a work-in-progress, growing as I advance through different topics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (optional, if using Expo)
- Android Studio or Xcode (for running on emulators/simulators)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Saifullahkhan31/react-native-learning.git
   cd react-native-learning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   - For Expo projects:
     ```sh
     npx expo start
     ```
   - For React Native CLI (Android):
     ```sh
     npx react-native run-android
     ```
   - For React Native CLI (iOS):
     ```sh
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```

## Features & Dependencies

- Written primarily in **TypeScript**.
- Minor usage of **Kotlin** and **JavaScript**.
- Includes typical React Native dependencies and libraries as required by the courses and experiments.

## Usage Example

You can launch the app on an emulator or physical device to explore the concepts covered in the latest modules.  
Feel free to browse the code, play with components, and adapt the examples as you learn!

## Contributing

Do you have suggestions for learning resources, courses, or React Native concepts I should cover?  
Would you like to offer advice, guidance, or corrections?

**All contributions are welcome!**
